                Welcome to the Exoplanet Learning Platform! This is an interactive learning tool designed to educate you about the fascinating
                world of exoplanetsâ€”planets that orbit stars outside our own solar system.
                </p>
                <p>
                Our platform is dedicated to providing rich resources about the discoveries, characteristics, and importance of exoplanets.
                Through our engaging materials, interactive gallery, and chatbot, we aim to make learning about exoplanets an enjoyable experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                Feel free to explore the gallery to see some amazing visuals, chat with our AI-powered chatbot, or refer to our carefully curated
                learning links to dive deeper into the subject!

                <h2>What is an Exoplanet?</h2>
                <p>
                An <strong>exoplanet</strong> (or extrasolar planet) is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system. These planets 
                can vary greatly in size, composition, and habitability, and discovering them helps scientists learn about the formation 
                and diversity of planetary systems in the universe.
